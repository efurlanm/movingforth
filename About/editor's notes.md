# Editor's Notes

- The github sources for this website are available at: <http://github.com/efurlanm/forth>
- The source markdown documents were also edited using Mark Text (<http://github.com/marktext/>) which is a good offline markdown document reader and also exports to PDF or HTML formats
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) static site generator and theme was used to build the website
- The tables were edited in Libreoffice Calc using a custom html template, then copied and pasted into the text
- Figures were edited using Libreoffice Drawn and exported as SVG. In trial-and-error testing, what looks best on the laptop monitor and smartphone screen are approximately 7 x 3 inch figures with font size 10 or 12
- The original documents were converted from html to markdown using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- PDF files were converted to TXT using [pdftotext](https://www.mankier.com/1/pdftotext/) (poppler-utils)
- The moving directory contains the original files that were converted to markdown
