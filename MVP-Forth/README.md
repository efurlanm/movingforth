# MVP-Forth for the Apple II

I downloaded the files from

<https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/images/programming/forth/>

and I tried to extract the content using CiderPress

<https://a2ciderpress.com/>

but I only managed to extract the disk `MVP Forth v1.0103.03 (1983)(Mountain View Press) - Assembly Source Code.dsk` and I have no idea how to extract the others.
